*** Singleton Pattern in TypeScript *** used in ws/src/RoomManager.ts

 In your snippet, Singleton is achieved by 3 things:

Private constructor

private constructor() {}


Prevents new RoomManager() from outside the class, so no one can freely create instances.

A static holder for the single instance

private static instance: RoomManager;


Lives on the class (not on an object). There’s only one of these per process.

A static accessor that lazily creates/returns the same object

static getInstance() {
  if (!this.instance) this.instance = new RoomManager();
  return this.instance; // always the same reference
}

How it works here (flow)

First call to RoomManager.getInstance() → instance is undefined → constructor runs once → instance stored.

Later calls → instance already set → the same object is returned.

Because the constructor is private, outside code cannot do new RoomManager().


This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it. Common use cases include managing shared resources like database connections, configuration settings, or logging services.

What is a “process” here? --> process is a program in execution

A process is your running Node.js program as seen by the OS (it has a PID and its own memory heap). In Node you can even access it via the global process object.

How your singleton behaves across time

With your RoomManager singleton:

The first time RoomManager.getInstance() is called in that process, it creates the instance and stores it in RoomManager.instance.

Every later call returns the same in-memory object.

It persists for the lifetime of that process (i.e., as long as your server keeps running) and is shared across all requests handled by that process.

So yes: once created, it stays alive until the process restarts (deploy/restart/crash), or the module is hot-reloaded in dev.

Important nuances

One process vs many
If you run multiple Node processes (e.g., cluster, PM2 with multiple instances, Docker replicas, or a Kubernetes deployment with >1 pod), each process gets its own singleton. They do not share memory. To sync state across processes/instances you’d use something like Redis pub/sub.

Serverless / cold starts
In serverless (Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda), each warm container keeps its own singleton between invocations. On a cold start or when the platform spins up another container, a new process is created → new singleton.

Dev hot reload
Tools like nodemon, tsx --watch, or Next.js dev can restart or re-evaluate modules. That can recreate your singleton. Don’t rely on it persisting across code reloads.

Threads vs processes
Node typically runs your JS on a single thread within a process. Worker Threads create separate isolates with their own memory—each worker would have its own singleton.

GC
Your static reference (RoomManager.instance) keeps the instance strongly referenced, so it won’t be garbage-collected until the process ends (or you clear it).

Rule of thumb

Same process: one shared singleton instance across all requests.

New process (restart/scale out/serverless cold start): new singleton.
